I’m Patrick and I’m currently a student at Santa Clara University working towards a bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Economics. Outside of school I enjoy spending time working with web optimization, contributing to open source projects like [jsDelivr](http://jsdelivr.com) and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/instovo), and spending time outdoors in the Bay Area.

I recently took up an interest in photography and you can checkout my photos (coming soon). My camera of choice is the [Canon 60D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_60D) with with the [EF 24-105mm f/4L Lens](http://www.kenrockwell.com/canon/lenses/24-105mm.htm#intro).
